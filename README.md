# Arduino Temperature-Controlled Fan with LED Indicator

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
An Arduino-based **temperature monitoring and fan control system** using the DHT11 sensor.  
- Temperature > **30Â°C** â†’ Fan turns **ON** + Red LED lights up.
- Temperature â‰¤ **30Â°C** â†’ Fan turns **OFF** + Green LED lights up.

This is ideal for **IoT, home automation, and embedded systems** portfolios.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install **DHT sensor library** from Arduino IDE:
   - Go to *Sketch â†’ Include Library â†’ Manage Libraries*
   - Search `"DHT sensor library"` and install.
2. Upload `temp_fan_control.ino` to your Arduino.
3. Open **Serial Monitor** at `9600 baud`.
4. Observe fan and LEDs respond to temperature changes.
